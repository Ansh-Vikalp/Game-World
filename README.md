# Game World-App

### A cross gaming🚴‍♀️ platform for all age groups.
 


## Problem Statement:

👉To design an amusement app for people to play simple games and destroy their boredem.
 
## Proposed Solution:
👉 A built of a Gaming app which uses Kotlin as it's backend and xml for it's frontend designing.



## Why this App?

It might happens many time to us that we get bored and got felling of loniness😕 after doing our work repiteadly. So, in that case 
what we do is just simply switch to our mobile phone📱 and starts playing heavy designed graphics game. However how our time get lost from 1 hr to 2 hr's to 3 hr's and successively
that never comes in our mind😓. Then we find ourselves with that I had wasted much of time.


What i have did is that I made an game app called Game World which is simple collections 3 games as follows.

#### 🎲 Dice Roller
#### 💰 Coin Toss
#### 🎱 Rock, Paper, Scissors

Which are the games we used to play in our childhood👱‍♂️ just for random fun and much over these these are non distracting and gives your mind a fresh start to your work✍.

Keeping in mind to design an app to be entertaining as well as non-disturbing is my main goal.So i did.

Hope that you all will find my app (Game World) entertaining🤹‍♀️ as well as refreshing. But also remember to get back soon to your original work.

# Functionality & Concepts Used:



- The main file which contains basic layout of my app as user presses app icon is contained in MainActivity.xml whereas the background tasks of various processes and clicks written as coding in Kotlin Language
   as backend work.

- Beside this the repository also contains three sub Kotlin Files and their respective xml files (MainActivity2, MainActivity3, MainActivity4) for layout of various apps

    1. MainActivity2 contains functionality of **Dice Roller**.
    2. MainActivity3 contains functionality of **Coin Toss**.
    3. MainActivity4 contains functionality of **Rock-Paper-Scissors**.


- The images used in app has been listed under  _drawable Resource Folder_ .

- The app **plays background music** as soon it opens also i had added sound for Dice Roll when button is pressed and coin Toss Sound similarly.

## Conepts:)
The background logic used in program made in Kotlin needs proper Understanding of-

`Class`

`Object`

`Variables`

`Functions`

`if-else block`

`Switch Cases`
